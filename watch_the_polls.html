      <h2>What do these numbers mean?</h2>
      <p>These numbers come from hundreds of state and national polls aggregated by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a> and made available through their <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api">Pollster API</a>. Raw polling numbers are related to &#8212 but not the same as &#8212 the probabilities that Obama or Romney will win a given state.</p>
      <h2>Why are there states without data?</h2>
      <p>The Huffington Post has not made the necessary data for these states available through their api. However, these states would be some of the least interesting to watch &#8212 Hawaii, Delaware, and Vermont have consistently supported Obama for months; the others have consistently supported Romney.</p>
